    </p>
    <p>
      I have 35+ years in the technology industry, built a successful tech career at Cisco (#2
      executive), been the CEO of a public company, invested in several other leading technology
      companies, and founded the Canary Foundation in 2004 to focus on early cancer technology. I
      currently serve on nine boards, am the CEO of RapidAI, and also serve as a technology partner
      at Sequoia Capital and Rally Ventures.

        With a focus on developing networking and data center technologies for the Internet, I began
        my career in 1980 at Develcon in Canada, marketing data switching technology for the
        mini-computer era. In the mid-1980s, I relocated to Silicon Valley and joined Cisco Systems in
        1990. During a 10-year tenure at Cisco, I built the IBM business unit, the Access business
        unit, and the Service Provider line of business&mdash;overseeing business totaling more than
        $12 billion in annual revenue. In 2000, I became CEO of Openwave, which invented much of the
        early mobile Internet technology.

        After 25 years of senior leadership operating experience, I founded the Canary Foundation in
        2004 and dedicated myself to philanthropic work in science and technology for the early
        detection of cancer. The Canary Foundation is the world&apos;s first non-profit organization
        focused solely on the funding, discovery, and development of tests for early cancer detection.
        I continue to be deeply involved with other cancer-related organizations. In 2009, I was
        appointed to the National Cancer Institute&apos;s Board of Scientific Advisors. I am a member
        of the Stanford Advisory Board for the Canary Center for Cancer Early Detection at Stanford
        and in 2018 I was honored to be awarded the Dean&apos;s Medal&mdash;the highest honor bestowed
        by the School of Medicine to individuals whose contributions have significantly advanced the
        mission of Stanford Medicine. I am also a consulting professor at Stanford University.
      </p>

        In 2018, I joined RapidAI as CEO. RapidAI is the worldwide leader in cerebrovascular imaging
        analysis, delivering the proven software tools that healthcare professionals around the world
        use to successfully identify and treat more stroke patients than ever before.

        I live part-time in Belize where I scuba dive daily and work on restoring and protecting the
        barrier reef. In 2010, my wife and I built the non-profit BelizeKids.org to support local
        community and education initiatives and have created a partnership with Stanford to deliver
        eye care for the local community.

        A native of Canada, I hold a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and an Honorary Doctorate
        of Law from the University of Saskatchewan, Canada where I continue to actively support
        student entrepreneurs.
