In the mid-1980s, I relocated to Silicon Valley and joined Cisco Systems in 1990. During a 10-year tenure at Cisco, I built the IBM business unit, the Access business unit, and the Service Provider line of business—overseeing business totaling more than $12 billion in annual revenue. In 2000, I became CEO of Openwave, which invented much of the early mobile Internet technology."

The Canary Foundation is the world’s first non-profit organization focused solely on the funding, discovery, and development of tests for early cancer detection. I continue to be deeply involved with other cancer-related organizations. In 2009, I was appointed to the National Cancer Institute’s Board of Scientific Advisors. I am a member of the Stanford Advisory Board for the Canary Center for Cancer Early Detection at Stanford and in 2018 I was honored to be awarded the Dean's Medal—the highest honor bestowed by the School of Medicine to individuals whose contributions have significantly advanced the mission of Stanford Medicine. I am also an adjunct professor in Radiology at Stanford University."

## Page family: /company/[slug] (Portfolio Details)

### Shared layout copy
- Category pill text displays the first applicable label out of "Board", "Investment", "Philanthropy", or "Spotlight." The pill is entirely hidden on the Sequoia partner network page. Hero logos are shown with their alt text (e.g., "AwareX logo") except on HWVP, Sequoia partner network, and TeleSoft Partners, where the media block is intentionally suppressed.
- Every detail page repeats the organization name as the page heading and renders the summary paragraph listed below.
- The button label is always "Visit official site" when an external URL is available. That CTA appears on these slugs: AwareX, BelizeKids.org, Calix, Carbon Robotics, Canary Foundation, Clarius Mobile Health, Cradle Genomics, D-Wave Systems, HWVP, National Institutes of Health, POET Technologies, Rally Ventures, RapidAI, Robin Systems, Sequoia partner network, Stanford Medicine, TeleSoft Partners, Teradici, Uberflip, VIDA, Zededa, and ZEVX.
- The Carbon Robotics detail is the only page that also shows the secondary button "Read press release," the "Latest News" section (kicker text "Latest News," heading "Carbon Robotics Raises $20M, Teases New “AI Robot” for Farms," summary sentence, and the six bullet points listed below), the "Media gallery" block (figure caption "Carbon Robotics LaserWeeder G2" with image alt text "Carbon Robotics LaserWeeder G2 operating at sunset in a field"), and the section heading "Field footage" above the embedded videos.
- Details without an external URL simply omit the CTA button, so no additional button text appears on those pages.
